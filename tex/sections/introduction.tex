\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

With the rise of open source software, more and more big corporations
incorporate free software in their stack. This also means that the amount of
meaningful software that is available online on platforms like GitHub
\cite{github}, is ever increasing. GitHub, as the name already suggest, offers
the ability to host Git repositories. Git is a distributed version control
system \cite{git}. In this paper an effort has been made to analyse Git commits
and gather information on their intended basic operation by looking at the
message of the commit. Therefore repositories of the top 10 most wanted
programming language according to \cite{so-survey} have been investigated. To
get a more accurate representation of each language, 100000 commits have been
chosen. To enhance diversity, only the last 10000 commits of each selected
repository were used.  The analysis has been done in Python.
