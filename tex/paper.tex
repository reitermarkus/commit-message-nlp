  \section{Introduction}
  In this paper an effort has been made to analyse commits and gather
  information on their intended basic operation by looking at the message of
  the commit. To full-fill on the premise repositories of the top 10 most wanted
  programming language according to \cite{so-survey} have been investigated. To
  get a more accurate representation of each language, 100000 commits have been
  chosen. To enhance diversity, each repository is limited to 10000 commits.
